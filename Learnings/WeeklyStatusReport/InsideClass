Week 1
- We learned about the importance of quality in the developement and maintainance of softwares.
- We also discussed about the problems in Pokemon Go and came up with innovative ideas to improve it.
- We also saw how people think and expect very differently from the same developement enviornment.
- We discussed various other project ideas that could use augmented reality and came up with a few interesting ones.
- We learned about Kano Model and classified our ideas based on satisfiers , delighters and dis-satisfiers and classified the requirements for the developement of our ideas into the 3 categories.
- We thus learned the importance of team work and diversity of isdeas through the exercise.

Week 2
- We discussed about the project and pondered on several ideas that we could develope.
- We discussed mainly about the problems with software developement.
- We spend rest of the time discussing about quality.

Week3
- We discussed about the problems in software distribution and maintainance.
- We learned that the problem with software developements are mainly related to maintainance and providing support for the development.

week4
-we discussed about the life cycle of software engineering and its different stages.It is different from human's lifecycle as we dont have control over design and stages of human lifecycle.
-we discussed about different models of lifecycle of software-engineering,tradiditional and agile.
        - Traditional one the waterfall model :- It is a linear sequential (non iterative) design process,no flexibility. 
        - Agile:-It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.
    but almost all model follow indirectly waterfall model.
-we discussed about requirement engineering and its complexity and importance.

week 5
-we discussed about evolutionary modael,iterative modaland different modals.
-we disscussed agile in detail
        its manefesto,and had a debate on it which clears out so many things.
        like individual over process plan
             working product over comprehensive documentation
             response to error over follow the plan
-scrum  an agile method in details and fixed that will follow it for our project.
-learned about estimation of software ,different methods like top-down,bottom-down,expert judgement ,priced to win etc
